I talk about the political effects of comics, the Internet, and other media, because I am an intersectional nerd.

## Why Attack on Titan is the Alt-Right's Favorite Manga

In [this piece](https://newrepublic.com/article/160193/attack-titan-alt-rights-favorite-manga) for _The New Republic_, I discuss the popular manga *Attack on Titan*, and the neo-Nazi fanbase it has accumulated.

I really like _Attack on Titan._ The point of the article, in my opinion, is that authorial intent is tricky, and declaring a piece of media "woke" or "not woke" is complicated. I tried to write a meditation on death of the author in the time of chan-boards, with Attack on Titan as a case study. Nazis think it's Nazi propaganda. Isayama thinks it's a personal story. I think it is, or at least it could be, a revolution of the once-colonized and a story that asks the difficult questions about repair.

## Can the Left Win YouTube?

In [this piece](https://newrepublic.com/article/154399/can-left-win-youtube) for _The New Republic_, I profile a popular cohort of left-wing content creators on YouTube.

I had been an obsessive fan of LeftTube for about 12 months before the piece ran: not its earliest days by any means, but before its creators really broke into the mainstream. I felt mild frustration that most media outlets had covered Natalie Wynn's content from the angle of deradicalization, while largely ignoring her other content _and_ the fascinating ecosystem to which she belonged. The hardest part of this piece was narrowing it down to just six creators to profile. I chose six of the most different people I could, to gesture at the vastness of the world. I hope I succeeded, though I will never live down the botched wording decision that implied that YouTuber Shaun is a skull.

## The Sprawling, Empathetic Adventure of Saga

In [this piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/03/saga-comic-series-image-issue-50/556481/) for _The Atlantic_, I review the groundbreaking representation and political content in the blockbuster graphic novel _Saga_.

When I read _Saga_ for the first time, I thought it was a series that should be mandatory reading for scholars of identity politics, asylum claims, and political violence. I also thought that it should be mandatory reading for people who believed comics cannot tell stories with all the nuance of literary novel. I found Staples and Vaughan's work to be arresting and important. I wrote this essay to try to say why.
