# I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I received my undergraduate degree in Mathematics from Williams College. My research interests concern politics of identity, in particular politics of illness, disability, and sex.
# 
# My dissertation, "Idea Brokers: Activism By and For Vulnerable Populations in Indonesia," examines Indonesian activists' political attitudes and strategies to conduct public information campaigns and secure rights protections for their vulnerable stakeholders: I use case studies for organizations that work with or for people who are vulnerable (e.g., disabled people, sexual violence survivors). My methodology is pluralist. In my dissertation, I use computational text analysis and discourse analysis to examine diffusion of words and conceptual frameworks across online news platforms, historical legal and policy research to contextualize activists' actions, and (most importantly) interviews to understand strategies from the actors working on their behalf. This research was made possible with the support of the National Science Foundation and the Luce Foundation.
# 
# I believe in the crafts of human pedagogy and human writing. When teaching, I strive to build a classroom devoted to rigorous analysis and intellectual exploration, conducted with empathy. My non-fiction writing covers a wide swathe of topics, ranging from ideology in media, legacies of violence linked to identity politics, political economy of development, and corruption.
# 
# My essays have appeared in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/shaan-amin/">The Atlantic</a>, <a href="https://caravanmagazine.in/author/1179">The Caravan</a>, and <a href="https://newrepublic.com/authors/shaan-amin">The New Republic</a>, as well as various small presses. I serve as an Assistant Features Editor for The Rumpus.
# 
# In my spare time, I practice yoga; dance salsa, bachata, and kizomba; perform endless rounds of physical therapy; and read.
