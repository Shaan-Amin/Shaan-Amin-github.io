Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I received my undergraduate degree in Mathematics from Williams College. My research interests concern politics of identity, in particular politics of illness, disability, and sex. I believe in the crafts of human pedagogy and human writing. When teaching, I strive to build a classroom devoted to rigorous analysis and intellectual exploration, conducted with empathy. In my spare time, I practice yoga; dance salsa, bachata, and kizomba; do lots of physical therapy; and read.
